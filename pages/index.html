<div class="about">
  
  <h1>Hi, I'm Andrew.</h1>

  <p>I work as a remote interaction designer at <a href="https://www.regions.com/personal-banking/" target="_blank">Regions Bank</a> from my home office in Cookeville, TN. My responsibilities include leading design projects and bridging the gap between designers and developers by building and maintaining a frontend design system.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, I consult with companies and organizations that want to create new or improve existing digital experiences. Some of my past projects have been working on websites, apps, user research, product roadmaps, and frontend development.</p>

  <p>I studied industrial design at Georgia Tech and typography at Savannah College of Art and Design while gaining real-world work experience at CNN and Turner Broadcasting. In my free time, I enjoy creative activities like playing guitar, restoring old furniture, taking photographs, and traveling around the country.</p>

  <p>View my <a href="/portfolio.html">portfolio</a> and <a href="/resume.html">resume</a> to learn more about my work and <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> if you’d like to talk—I’m always interested in making new connections!</p>
