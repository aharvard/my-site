I work as a Senior UX Engineer at Regions Bank. Currently, I'm coding UIs for the bank's websites, consulting on front-end system architecture, and implementing an enterprise-wide design system.

I enjoy writing modern CSS and designing accessible HTML patterns. I believe that design is a team sport, and I love working with designers, content strategists, researchers, and product folks.

In 2011, I started my career as a UX designer and enjoyed being a generalist. Since 2015, I've specialized in interaction design and front-end development.

I studied industrial design at Georgia Tech and typography at Savannah College of Art and Design. During that time, I gained work experience at CNN and Turner Broadcasting.

I work from my home office in Cookeville, TN and I'm a proud cat dad to Davy, Johnny, and Walter.
