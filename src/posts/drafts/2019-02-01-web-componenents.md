Web components are ideal candidates for delivering design systems in organizations where tech stacks rely on various front-end JavaScript frameworks and libraries.

They mitigate framework lock-in by delivering encapsulated vanilla styling and behavior.

They may not be great candidates for full-fledged single-page apps (at the time of this post) due to some accessibility limitations with the shadow DOM and [Accessibility Object Model (AOM)](http://wicg.github.io/aom/explainer.html) specs.

## What are Web Components?

“Web Components” represent a collection of browser specifications that allow designers and developers to create and reuse custom HTML tags that can deliver scoped styles and custom behaviors—the specs are:

- [Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements): create your own HTML tags—B.Y.O.T(ag).
- [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM): provide scoped styles and behaviors by isolating DOM nodes (sounds spooky)
- [HTML Templates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots): define element structure and expose "entry-points" (slots) to pass in children elements
- [JavaScript Modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/): export and import reusable code

### As Defined by Webcomponents.org:

<figure>
  <blockquote>... a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps... [web components] work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.</blockquote>

## How do you make Web Components?

You can create Web components with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and you can find some in-depth resources on MDN's [Concepts and Usage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).

If you need to support older browsers, you will need to use polyfills. Also, be sure to take extra care to ensure accessibility.

### Stencil

I find the ergonomics of writing vanilla JS for Web Components to be complicated, and [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) simplifies things.

I like to think of Stencil as somewhat of a Babel- or Sass-like tool for web components.

Stencil is a compiler that outputs optimized vanilla JS while also taking care of polyfills.

As they say on their website: "Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular front-end frameworks and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any modern browser."

**Note: Stencil is not Ionic!** While the Ionic team is behind Stencil, it's a stand-alone tool that does not depend on the Ionic framework.

### Stencil announced at 2017 Polymer Summit

I've cued up the video to the point where they announce Stencil. If you want more of the backstory, I recommend watching from the beginning.

### Leveling Up ++

If you want to learn more about how to build web components with (or without) Stencil, I highly recommend this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/web-components-stenciljs-build-custom-html-elements/) by [Maximilian](https://twitter.com/maxedapps):
