As a designer/developer hybrid, I'm looking for a new opportunities that allows me to balance my design experience with passion for engineering user interfaces—also open to roles that may focus solely on design or development.

I bring senior-level UX/UI design direction while also executing accessible HTML and modern CSS, with a sharp eye for typography, spacing, and color. Currently, I'm honing my vanilla JavaScript skills and I really enjoy working in the JAM stack.

I studied industrial design at Georgia Tech and typography at Savannah College of Art and Design while gaining real-world work experience at CNN and Turner Broadcasting. In my free time, I enjoy creative activities like playing guitar, sewing, and photography.
