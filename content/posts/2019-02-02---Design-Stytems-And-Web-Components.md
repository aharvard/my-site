Web components are ideal candidates for delivering design systems in organizations where tech stacks rely on a variety of front-end frameworks and libraries. They can reduce dependency-hell and spaghetti-code by encapsulating styling and behaviorâ€”write once and use them wherever HTML works (polyfills required).

## What are Web Components?

"Web Components" represent a collection of browser specifications that allow designers and developers to create and reuse custom HTML tags that can deliver scoped styles and custom behaviors.

I wrote a post about [Web Components in 2019](/posts/web-components-2019/) that goes into detail and provides some helpful links.

ðŸ“¢ Bottom line: if you can use HTML, you can use Web Components.

## How do Web Components empower designs systems?

There are some many cool ways to make awesome websites nowadays. A lot of the most recent front-end tooling has empowered designer and developers to collaborate more than ever before. Design deliverables are now extending all the way into the browser and design assets are being powered by codeâ€”wow.
