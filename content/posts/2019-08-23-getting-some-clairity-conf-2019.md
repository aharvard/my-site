I had the privilege to attend Clarity Conf, 2019 in San Fransisco and it was amazing. 

Clarity is a conference about design systems and the people who make them. It's organized by Jina Anne and has been steadily growing since its start, 4 years ago.

Sadly, I was unable to attend any of the pre-conference workshops this year but would love to try next time!
