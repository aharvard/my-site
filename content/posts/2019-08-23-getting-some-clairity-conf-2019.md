I had the privilege to attend Clarity Conf, 2019 in San Fransisco and it was amazing. 

Clarity is a conference about design systems and the people who make them. It's organized by Jina Anne and has been steadily growing since its start, 4 years ago.

Sadly, I was unable to attend any of the pre-conference workshops this year but would love to try next time!

## Day One

### Co-Create: Creating Better Together

This what my first time hearing Denise Jacobs speak. She brought tons of energy and was the perfect person to kick off this conference. 

She had all of us in the audience interact with each other, usually something I dislike, but in this case it was great. She used audience participation to teach us about listening to each other.

The main part of her talk went into some details about ways to co-create:

#### Unblock
- we have a fear of not being enough and being judge
- we self-censor—ideacide
- keep an experimental mindset—leads to inspiration

#### Connect
- none of us is as smart as all of us
- be generous
- must LISTEN
- overtalking === muting others
- be present, pay attention, relax your agenda

#### Diversify
- difference perspectives leads to difference solutions
- diversity of people leads to a diversity of ideas

#### Play
- be expressive
- improv/plussing: start where you are, accept the offer, commit fully, yes and, make others look good
- encourage stupid ideas
- do in public space
